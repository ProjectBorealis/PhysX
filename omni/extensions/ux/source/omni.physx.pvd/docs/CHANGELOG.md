## [107.3.24] - 2025-09-05
Bug Fix: References that did not resolve to an object were previously not selectable but failed silently; this behavior is now corrected.
Reference Handling:
  Handles with value 0 are shown as "NULL".
  Handles that donâ€™t resolve are displayed as "INVALID".
  Handles that do resolve to an object display the USD Prim name; if the object is inactive, it is shown grayed out but still displays its name.
  The handle value is now displayed alongside the USD Prim name for references.

Property Array Improvements:
  Property arrays with more than 10 values are now paginated, facilitating inspection of large arrays.

Navigation Enhancements:
  "Previous" and "Next Reference" buttons have been added below the search bar in the OVD Tree.
  Contextual navigation ensures that using "jump to reference" buttons in the property view returns to the exact scroll position and pagination state.
